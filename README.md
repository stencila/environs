This repository provides images and tools for using Stencila within containers. Use cases include:

- using Stencila packages for R, Python and Node.js without having to install them individually

- collaborating on a Stencila document using an identical computing environment

- publishing a Stencila document as a self-contained, reproducible, computational bundle

### Images

Our "comprehensive" images have a large number of packages installed and are intended to be sufficient for most data analysis tasks without having to install more packages. Out "minimal" images have just the bare essentials necessary for running a Stencila Host (the thing that provides execution contexts and other resources for each language).

Image                        | Summary
:----------------------------| :-----------------------------------------------------------------
[base](base)                 | A base image with Stencila packages for Python, R and/or Node.js
[core](core)                 | An image with commonly used packages for data analysis in each language
[mega](mega)                 | Comprehensive images with _a lot_ of packages for each language

To use these images simply run them with the container's port 2000 bound to a port on the host. Use a value in the range 2010-2100 so that it will be automatically be detected by the Stencila client (e.g. Stencila Desktop) without clashing:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 2100:2000 stencila/core
```

### Tools

Some of these images are large (i.e. ~1GB compressed). The [shrink-docker.sh](.shrink/shrink-docker.sh) script provides a way to shrink an image down to the minimum size necessary to reproduce your document.


### Develop

The files `default.nix`, `node-packages.nix` and `node-env.nix` are generated by [`node2nix`](https://github.com/svanderburg/node2nix) from `node-packages.json`. Install `node2nix` using:

```bash
nix-env -f '<nixpkgs>' -iA nodePackages.node2nix
```

If you update `node-packages.json` then it is necessary to re-generate these files using:

```bash
node2nix -6 -i ../packages.json
```

## Run Stencila in a Nix shell

On NixOS or other linux with Nix installed run:

```
nix-shell core
```

To 

```
nix-shell core/r
```

Within the Nix shell, three Stencila scripts are available

- `stencila-manifest`: display a JSON manifest of the Stencila hosts and the packages installed within each
- `stencila-register`: register the Stencila hosts so that they can discover each another within the environment
- `stencila-run`: run the primary Stencila host in the environment


## Run Stencila in a Docker Container

On NixOS, or Linux with Nix installed, run:

```bash
nix-build core/r
````

This will create a tar archived Docker container in your Nix store e.g. `/nix/store/ci3k7fwnza75r9hg3wv0ab9c8544hmj8-docker-image-core-r.tar.gz` and a symlink to that file in the current directory called `result`.

Load that tar archive as a Docker image using:

```bash
docker load -i result
```

Then run the image:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 2100:2000 stencila/core/r
```

To recover space you can clean up the Docker tar archive with:

```bash
nix-store --delete /nix/store/*-docker-image-stencila-*.tar.gz
```
